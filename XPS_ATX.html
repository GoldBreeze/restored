<p style="color:green" class="squish">___ I have finally finished this project, but first, let me give you some backstory. A couple months ago, I ordered all of the pieces I would need. However, they were stolen from the front door upon arrival. This is where I thought the project would end. Luckily for me, I was funded to buy all of the pieces again, and they all arrived to me, safe and sound... except for one; the ATX motherboard tray. This piece was crucial if I was to convert my old Dell XPS 710, which used a BTX configuration for it's motherboard, into a new ATX configured pc. It turns out that the company I ordered it from just shut down, but didn't tell anyone (I learned this info on a chat, where a former employee of theirs spilled the beans). I ordered the motherboard tray for the third time from a different, but equally sketchy site, and it finally arrived.</p>

<p class="red">So now onto the process of converting my Dell into a nice new speedy gaming pc!</p>
